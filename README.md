# About the Visualization and Machine Learning Project

# The code for this project was written by me as part of the course work for my Python Scripting for Data Science course (ITEC 3100). The project was designed to require us to use Visualization libraries and Machine Learning libraries.

# The comments throughout the code were for my professor and to highlight each step we were required to cover on our assignment sheet.

# I received an A for this project.
